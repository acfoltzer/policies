# Haskell Citizen Code of Conduct

**Note**: This repository does not contain an adopted policy. Rather,
  it is a place for the community to collaborate in building policies
  that may be adopted in the future.

This is a fork of Stumptown Syndicate's
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) to be
adapted to the needs of the Haskell community. Pull requests welcome
:)
